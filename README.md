# 275-Mini-Project-1

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Project1-Caffeine. This project includes a comprehensive report, source code in Python, Java, and C++, and test data necessary for evaluation. Our goal is to provide a clear, structured, and easy-to-navigate repository for both the development team and external reviewers.

## Project Structure

- `miniproject.pdf`: Contains the project report, including a list of dependencies and instructions for retrieval, installation, and configuration.
- `python-src`: Contains the Python source code.
- `java-src`: Contains the Java source code.
- `cpp-src`: Contains the C++ source code..

## Dependencies

Please refer to `miniproject.pdf` for a detailed list of dependencies and instructions on how to install and configure them.

## Running the Code

### Python

Navigate to the `python-src` directory. To run the Python code, use the following command:


python3 /path/to/client_or_server.py

### Java

./client.sh  # To start the client
./server.sh  # To start the server

Alternatively, you can compile and run the Java code manually using javac and java command

### CPP

Navigate to the cpp-src/build directory and run the following commands to compile and run the C++ code:
cmake ..
make

After compiling, you can run the generated executable(s) located within the build directory. The exact command will depend on the naming convention of your project's output file, for example:
./clientApp
